In response to President Moon Jae-in's statement on the 11th, when the number of new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) new cases surpassed 2,000 for the first time, "Korea is still in a relatively better situation than other countries" "Why is there no mention of it?" Kim Yeon-joo, a spokesperson for the People's Power, said in a commentary on the same day, "Is the president's awareness of the corona situation at this level?" In the end, the reason that the situation in the country is getting worse is because of the president's easy perception of the situation.
Wasn't it?" he pointed out, "Isn't the remark of 'relatively better conditions' on the day when the number of confirmed cases per day was the highest?" Korea's vaccination completion rate is 15%, the last among the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and lower than the global average (15.3%).

As of the 9th, only 7% of the 40 million doses of vaccines that were secured by talking with the CEO were actually introduced.
I wonder why there isn't."
